Hi, and welcome to Bibs & Beans' Book Club, with Bibs the Cat and Beans the dog!

This cute lil app will help you navigate through the Google Books Library to tell you everything you need to know about the books in which you're interested. 

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Ruby installed! :)
2. Open up your terminal on your machine and navigate to where you have the program folder saved.
3. From inside the folder, enter "Bundle install" into your terminal.
4. Copy and paste the following command to your terminal: ruby bin/run.rb
5. Browse some books with Bibs & Beans.

***NOTE*** the data provided in this program is limited due to the size of the Google Reads library. To alter the data, feel free to pop into our "db" file, click "seeds.rb," then add or remove search terms. Be sure to put your search in quotes, and add a comma.

Don't forget to ike us on Facebook! 

Just kidding, there's no Facebook for this. 

Happy reading!
